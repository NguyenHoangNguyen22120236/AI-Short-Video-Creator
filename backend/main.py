    '''In a bustling hospital, a young doctor stares at a screen filled with erratic patient data—a man’s fever won’t break, his organs failing mysteriously. She whispers, “I need help,” and taps a command. The AI system hums to life, its algorithms devouring decades of research in seconds.''',
    '''The screen flashes a rare diagnosis: an autoimmune reaction triggered by a forgotten antibiotic. The doctor’s eyes widen—she orders a targeted treatment. Across the hall, the patient’s vitals stabilize as nurses watch monitors in relieved silence.''',
